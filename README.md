draftBetter
===========

A web app to help optimize draft choices for fantasy baseball.

I figure that there are three important aspects to doing well in a fantasy
baseball:

  1. Projecting player peformance accurately
  2. Optimizing choices in the draft
  3. Team maintenance during season

This app focuses on the second aspect - draft optimization.
